# Timer
This cross-platform desktop timer consists of two repeating segments: a work segment and a break segment. It sits on your desktop and in the task bar so you can easily view the current countdown time while working on your computer. It is built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

4. In another terminal, run the electron app: `npm run electron`
